TRELLO test suite - made for recrutation puropses by Lukasz B.
for Netguru

What you will need?
Eclipse (I am using photon but any other IDE should work too)
Java JDK (I am using jdk1.8.0_121)
Chrome browser
Firefox x32 browser (might be some issues on x64 version

How to launch test suite?
Launch the IDE
Simply pull this project and import as maven project.
Right click on the root (top folder) and run as Maven clean
Clean the project.
Then click on Maven and update project (dependencies should be uploaded).
Run the test from created XML file = TrelloTestSuite.xml

How does it works?
If you have launched the xml file mentioned above the test should run by itself.
Simply choose a browser you wish to run test with. (NOTE: FF x32 migh be required).
Screenshots are being saved in the project so keep in mind when trying to push it somwhere else.

Browser drivers are included.
